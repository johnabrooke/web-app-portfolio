        <h2>Ch.8 Forms</h2>
        <h3>Accessing Form Elements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><code>document.forms</code>: legacy DOM property that returns an HTML collection of all the forms in the document in the order
                 they appear in the markup, a collection will be returned even if there is only one form; it will be a collection of one. 
                 (ex. <code>documetn.forms[0];</code> returns the first form object)</li>
            <li>Instead of using a numerical index, we can use the name attribute to identify a form:

                <code>const form = document.forms.search;</code>

                Be careful referencing elements in this way, however. If the form had the same name as any properties or methods of the 
                document.forms object, such as 'submit', for example, that property or method would be referenced instead of the 
                <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> element. This is unlikely to happen, as the document.form object doesn't have many properties 
                or methods, but it is something to be aware of. To avoid this, square bracket notation can be used (this is also required if 
                the formâ€™s name attribute contains any invalid characters, such as spaces or dashes):
                
                <code>const form = document.forms['search'];</code></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Ch.12 Object Oriented Programming</h2>
        <h3>Constructor Property</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>All objects have a constructor property.</li>
            <li>The constructor property returns the constructor function that created it.</li>
            <li>When a new object is created using an object literal, the <code>Object</code>constructor (one of the built-in constructor 
                functions in JavaScript) is being used in the background.</li>
            <li>The constructor property can be used to instatiate a copy of an object.  This is helpful when the constuctor name is unknown
                because there's no need to reference the constructor function or class declaration directly.  For example:<br>
                <code>const greenDice = new redDice.constructor(10);</code></li>
        </ul>
