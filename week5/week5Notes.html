    <h1>Week 5 Notes</h1>
    <h2>Ch. 10 Testing and Debugging</h2>
    <h3>Chapter Summary</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Bugs are unavoidable in code, and it’s best to find them early rather than later.</li>
        <li>JavaScript can be put into strict mode using the string <code>"use strict"</code>. 
            This can be used in a whole file or just a single function.</li>
        <li>Linting tools can be used to ensure your code follows good practice and conventions.</li>
        <li>Feature detection can check whether a method is supported before calling it, helping to 
            avoid an exception being thrown.</li>
        <li>The console and browser’s built-in debugging tool can be used to interactively find and 
            fix bugs in code.</li>
        <li>Exceptions can be thrown using the throw statement.</li>
        <li>An error object is created when an exception occurs.</li>
        <li>Any code placed inside a try block will pass any error 
            objects to a catch block when an exception occurs. Any code inside a finally block will 
            run if an exception does or does not occur.</li>
        <li>Test-driven development is the practice of writing tests that fail, then writing the code
             that passes the test, then refactoring the code every time a new feature is implemented.</li>
        <li>The Jest framework can be used to test your code.</li>     
    </ul>
